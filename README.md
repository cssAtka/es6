# es6

Build sample app:
- Create a class.
- Create an extended class.
- Separate classes into modules.
- Classes should log their classnames to the console.
- Implement data setter/getter in base class.
- Add a toUppercase function into your codes which is reusable.
- Set a lowercase string inside the extended class.
- Have a config file with an isUppercase configuration.
- Based on the config value, the getter should return with the uppercase/lowercase version of data.
